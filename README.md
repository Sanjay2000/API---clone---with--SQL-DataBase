# SQLite3-Database
###  In this project I have to write Saral-like-API by use of SQLite database. I have created saraldb database in this database create two table courses and exercise. this project we can test on postman also uses the express module in this project.

## Installing the SQLite3 Driver for Node.js
Now that I have created our project, I did install the node-sqlite3 package from npm using the following command:

    sudo apt-get update
    npm install sqlite3 --save
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.
sudo apt-get install npm
npm install express --save
To run your code, first, open your server port using node file_name.js in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations with the database.
